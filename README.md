# 💻 My Java DSA Journey

📍 **Purpose:**  
This repository is my personal space to track my progress in solving Data Structures & Algorithms problems using **Java**.

🛠️ I started with very basic logic and slowly built up consistency and confidence.  
Now I’m solving problems regularly — not for perfection, but for progress.

⚡ No pressure. No race. Just me vs. me — showing up, learning, and getting better every day.

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

Sometimes, it’s easy to forget how far you’ve come.  
This repo is a reminder to myself — that I’ve grown, I’m still growing, and I’ll keep showing up.

👀 If future me is reading this... keep going. You’ve got this. 🔥
